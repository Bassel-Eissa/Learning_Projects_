Main findings:
-----------------
Started by extracting 41 features and preprocessing to get finally 9 columns divided as follows
1)Info. : includes 2 columns (Country and Gender)
2)Attitudes:  include 6 columns (Motivation - Anxiety - Self_concept - Wrok_Ethic - Behavior - interest)
3)Math Score one column

Firstly, i checked the distribution for each of these 3 points in univariate visualizations
Then, stat to look at all attitudes and math score for each gender
finally, looked at the features (Attitudes that may have effect on math scores)
